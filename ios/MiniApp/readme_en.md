## ü§î What is FinClip?

Have you ever **thought** that the developed WeChat Mini-App can be put in your own APP to run directly, and you only need to develop the Mini-App once, and then you can open it in different applications, isn't it incredible?

Have you ever **tried** to introduce an SDK in your own APP, and you can not only open the Mini-App in the app, but also customize the Mini-App interface and modify the Mini-App style, don't you think it is more incredible?

**This is FinClip, with much INCREDIBLE !**

## üéÅ Origin of the name
FinClip = Finogeeks + Clips, which is developed by the team of Finogeeks Technoplogy Co., Ltd. "Fin" is the abbreviation of the company's name `Finogeeks`, and Clip comes from the `App Clip` concept proposed by Apple in WWDC 2020. By combining the two, we hope to help developers provide a simple, easy-to-use Mini-App container framework, so that every app can have the ability to run Mini-App.
